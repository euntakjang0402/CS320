How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I assured functioning for this project by methodically developing JUnit tests that covered both positive and negative circumstances. To improve security, I included validation checks and handled any exceptions, assuring the application's robustness.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I thoroughly analyzed the requirements presented, converting them into precise features and limits inside the program. I ensured that the application matched the demands of the users by carefully building services such as ContactService, TaskService, and AppointmentService.

How do I approach designing software?
I started with a modular architecture in this project, dividing functionality into discrete services to ensure clarity and maintainability. Using best practices and design concepts such as encapsulation and separation of responsibilities, I created a scalable and user-friendly architecture.
